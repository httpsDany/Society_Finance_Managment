# Society_Finance_Managment
A web interface to help societies and colonies mange the finance.

In this project i have made a web application that can help societies manage there finance, focusing on society managment fee and rent collection along with fine system that gets trigger if rent is due

The webapp is extremly simplified with high flexibility for admin, such as:
- Adding/deleting any user
- Defining the no. of buildings, floors in each building and flats in each building [having this info auto-genrates a tables of residents wih their flatno.]
- Defining types of flat (1bhk,2bhk....) and there rents.
- Different pages for admin and normal user.
- Oauth signup and login
-etc

Also i have tried deploying the backend in a free hosting platform however the latency is high and it needs some polishing.
